New users can sign up for an account with a unique username, email, and password. The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure sessions and bcrypt for password hashing to ensure user data is protected. Existing users can log in through a dedicated portal.

The home feed is the central hub of the application. It dynamically fetches and displays posts in chronological order from all the users that the logged-in user follows. The feed supports both images and videos and is built for infinite scrolling, providing a seamless browsing experience.

Users can easily share their moments by creating new posts. The 'Create Post' feature includes an image or video upload functionality, a field for writing captions, and the ability to add relevant hashtags. Once submitted, the new post is instantly added to their profile and appears on their followers' feeds

Engagement is key to the social experience. Users can like any post, with a real-time update to the like count. They can also leave comments to share their thoughts and interact with the post's creator and other users. The comment section is displayed directly beneath each post.

Every user has a personal profile page that displays their bio, profile picture, and a grid of all their posts. This page also shows their follower and following counts. Users can follow or unfollow others directly from their profile pages, which updates the content shown on their home feed.

The application includes a real-time direct messaging system, allowing users to have private, one-on-one conversations. Built with Socket.IO, the chat provides instant message delivery without needing to refresh the page. Users can view their list of conversations and access their full message history with any other user, creating a seamless and interactive communication experience.
